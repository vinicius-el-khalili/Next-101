# Next js tutorial - Net Ninja

## 1. Intro & Setup

- ```npx create-next-app app-name```

## 2. Pages & Routes

- Routing is done automatically by Next, mirroring the file structure in the project.
- Each page is a react component inside the ```pages``` folder.
- Subfolders also are mirrored as routes in the application.
- ```index.js``` files are the default page for any given route/subfolder.

## 3. Importing components

- Import syntax is the same as React.
```import Component from "../components/Component"```
